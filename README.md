# Hack Technology / Project Attempted

## What you built?

I made a simple Bobatracking app using react native. You can just add your drinks and view your history of all the drinks you've had in the past.

## Who Did What?

I did it myself.

## What you learned

This is the first time I used react native, even though I've done work with react before. I primarily just wanted to see what the difference between React Native and XCode was and which one was simpler to make an ios app. I learned how easy it was to use react native, it is essentially the same as react but with just a few small differences. I thnk if I want to create a mobile app for my final project, I will use react native rather than swift/xcode.
